# Daytime Brightness Control
Automatically adjust device brightness for the nighttime / daytime

To help recovering sleep schedule ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


Application will set brightness to minimum level after 23:00 (local time) and set to 100% after 07:00.
Autostart is not supported for now, start application from the Windows start menu.

## Build
```python -m nsist installer.cfg```
